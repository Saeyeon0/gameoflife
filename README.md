As a clue I used the code published on OCS as a reference.
My game contains 3 characters, which are men(blue), women(pink) and children(orange).
So basically, all men and women are the parents of appearing children.
Parents suppose to appear as a small heart shapes, men: down left corner on a grid of nine squares, women: up right corner on a grid of nine squares.
They mix up on a random grid of squares and children also start to show up on random squares.
They run altogether and at the end, all cells die.
